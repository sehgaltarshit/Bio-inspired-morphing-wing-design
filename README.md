Hi, this is my Bachelor Thesis Project. It is based on Bio-inspired morphing wing design for improved aerodynamic performance in miniature aerial vehicles. 
The BTP_presentation and BTP_report contains the initial part of my work on this topic, where I explore if dragonfly are optimized for aerodynamic performance and some comparsion with existing literature
For the second part, I started to explore the morphing strategies of the wing. The results of this part is in "BTP2_presentation"
The BTP2 is still not fully complete and is under works
